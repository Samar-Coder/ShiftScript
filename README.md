# ShiftScript
ShiftScript is a Python program that encrypts and decrypts messages using the Caesar cipher, a simple letter-shifting technique. It features an ASCII art logo for added style. Users can encode or decode messages with a custom shift value, making it a fun and interactive way to learn basic cryptography.
